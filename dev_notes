Project Customization Tasks:
    Figuring how the Tool Indicator will be updated when selecting these tools:
    - Brush
    - Create shapes (Best way to keep track of selected btns? Package into a array of booleans?)
    - Eraser

    *Changing UI:
    - Change top-bar into a sidebar [B]
    - Create hover side panel to place colour picker & brush slider?
        - Do the same for the fill bucket?
    - Fix canvas height issue
    - Implement toast notifications for bottom layer tools instead  of using the tool Indicator

    CURRENTLY WORKING ON THE CSS OF THE TOOL SETTINGS:
        - Temporarily activated by right clicking the eraser button

Ideas:
- kleki
- jspaint
